I have taught mathematics, statisitics, and computer science in both one on one and classroom settings.
I can aid with the following subjects:

<ul>
<li>HS and lower division undergrad math (Algebra, Trig, Geometry, Calc, Stats etc.)</li>
<li>Linear Algebra</li>
<li>Probability and Statistics</li>
<li>Machine learning</li>
<li>Discrete Mathematics</li>
<li>Univariate and Multivariate Calculus</li>
<li>Algorithms</li>
<li>Software Engineering</li>
<li>Mock coding interviews</li>
</ul>

Learning mathematics is hard.  But not any harder than learning music or a new physical 
skill.  Tutoring meetings should be expected to be high intensity training sessions
where we establish the framework for self study.  We set the correct expectations for the
domain of interest as well as workshop a disciplined and appropriately paced curriculum.

Feel free to inquire with questions about your particular study goals.
