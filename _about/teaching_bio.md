I am available as tutor, mentor, or consultant in a variety of capacities.

<h3>Professional Consulting</h3>
I regularly source and interview data science candidates, and can provide
 feedback on resumes, practice coding and mathematical interview questions,
 and consult on general questions regarding a career in data science.

<h3>General Teaching Philosophy</h3>

I aim to make every class or tutoring session a period of high intensity training.
 However I assume that for the student, it is only be beginning of their training,
 and that for every hour spent in class in a tutoring session with me, at
 least one hour will be spent in self-study to completely master the topic.
  Together we lay the ground work and the pace for that study.
Tutoring is not be an extension of lecture, but a training session where
I expect a high level of student effort, attention and creativity.
My method is to quickly develop a casual but engaging rapport with
the student so that we feel comfortable making mistakes in front of
each other and are able to collaborate on a learning method rather than
drilling problems.  The aim is two fold: to help students realize the
level of commitment, work, and mental awareness required to really master
subjects, as well as instill confidence that they are capable of doing so.
