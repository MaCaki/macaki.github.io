I am <strong> currently available for tutoring </strong> in any subject of undergraduate and high school mathematics as well as programming.  My radius on in person tutoring covers San Francisco and 15 min by car beyond that.  

I have four years of teaching experience in a variety of roles from principal instructor of college math classes to one-on-one mentoring with high school students.  Therefore, I have mastered  all aspects of undergraduate and high school math (my MA permits me to use this self-qualification) as well as the fundamentals of computer science. 

Things I can tutor: 
- Algebra 1 and 2
- Precalculus
- Trigonometry
- Geometry
- Calculus 1,2 and 3
- Linear Algebra
 

The philosophy that I bring to every class and tutoring session is that it is going to be a period of high intensity training.  However I assume that for the student, it is only be beginning of their training, and that for every hour spent in class in a tutoring session with me, at least one hour will be spent in self-study to completely master the topic.  Together we lay the ground work and the pace for that study. Tutoring is not be an extension of lecture, but a training session where I exepect a high level of student effort, attention and creativity.  My method is to quickly develop a casual but engaging rapport with the student so that we feel comfortable making mistakes in front of eachother and are able to collaborate on a learning method rather than drilling problems.  The aim is two fold: to help students realize the level of commitment, work, and intellectual awareness required to really master subjects, as well as instill confidence that they are capable of doing so.
