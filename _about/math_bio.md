I am interested in polytopes whose normal fans are related to the classical symmetry groups and submodular functions such as Coxeter matroid polytopes, and generalized permutohedra.   I want to see how we can use groups and other algebraic structures to describe geometric phenomena, and vice versa. Currently I am trying to see how certain set functions and problems from classical combinatorial optimization can be generalized beyond the Symmetric group.
