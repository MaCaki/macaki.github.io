I am interested in polytopes whose symmetries are (somewhat) related to the classical symmetry groups and submodular functions.  I am particularly fascinated by Coxeter matroid polytopes, and generalized permutohedra.  I.e. Using groups and other algebraic structures to describe geometric phenomena, and vice versa.
