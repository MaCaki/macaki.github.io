I am sometimes available to provide consulting and IC work on projects involving
data engineering, data infrastructure, ad hoc analysis, design of 
machine learning systems, and general data strategy.  

Setting up a good data model and strategy for data collection can usually determine success
of a data project.  What this means in practice is simply defining the right schema for your
prospective set of questions and ensuring immutability of the data warehouse and idempotency of 
Jobs.  This requires somewhat tedious and detail oriented work that I've developed sensitivities 
to and strategies for during my time on data teams at high growth start-ups.  As an ML practictioner
I generally think in terms of long term capabilities to summarize data into trained models and
extract value in the form of downstream data products.
