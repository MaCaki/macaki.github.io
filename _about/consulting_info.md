I provide consulting and independent contractor work in data engineering, infrastructure, analysis, machine learning systems design, and data strategy.

A well-designed data model and collection strategy is often the key determinant of a data project's success. This means creating the right schema for your analytical needs while ensuring data warehouse immutability and job idempotency. Through my experience on data teams at high-growth startups, I've developed expertise in this detail-oriented work and built effective strategies to manage it. As a machine learning practitioner, I focus on building long-term capabilities to transform data into trained models and create valuable downstream data products.
