I do research in combinatorial optimization and machine learning.  
My mathematical work deals with a class of polytopes related to classical root systems and submodular set functions. More broadly I am interested in combinatorics and discrete geometry. 

I also develop machine learning algorithms for medical applications.  Currently I am interested in training convolutional neural networks to detect infections in eyes using noisy images.
