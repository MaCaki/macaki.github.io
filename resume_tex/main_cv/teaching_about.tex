\section{\sc  About Me}

I am a graduate student in mathematics doing research in combinatorics, coxeter group theory and discrete geometry.  I have extensive experience working with high school age students through standardized and improvized curriculum.  Additionally, I have six semesters of experience teaching and TAing first and second year university math courses. \par My multidisciplinary background in philosophy, logic, and computer science gives me multiple pedagogical approaches to problems.  I strive to teach, not specific theorems, but a process of reasoning that has allowed me to succeed in accelerated mathematical curriculum. My teaching is an intense mental training in preparation for productive self-study.
