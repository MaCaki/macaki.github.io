 
\section{\sc  About Me}

I am a mathematician and data scientist with a strong interest in combinatorial geometry, combinatorial optimization, and probabilistic graphical models.  I am currently interested in artificial vision for classifying medical images taken in the field. In parallel I am doing research in discrete geometry on a family of combinatorially interesting polytopes. I have industry experience in Java programming for an enterprise data base application and extensive scripting skills.
