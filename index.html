							<h5><strong> Square Bitcoin Conversions </strong> at Block Inc </h5>
							<p>I created the first integration of CashApp into Square seller accounts, enabling automated and instant transfer of card sale proceeds to CashApp for bitcoin conversion (effectively creating an SMB bitcoin treasury). After recruiting 5-7 engineers from across Block, I guided the project from hackweek through alpha release, culminating in general availability in April 2024.</p>

<p>As the founding engineer, I served as technical lead, project manager, and occasional informal engineering manager. I collaborated closely with both Square and CashApp engineering teams while working with Square leadership to champion the feature’s vision and value, including presenting alongside Block Leadership at the company-wide meeting.

						<p> 
							<h5><strong> Bitcoin Ephemera </strong> at Inscribing Atlantis </h5>
							<p>I worked with a digital artist and the lead developer of the ordinal protocol to create and launch a novel auction mechanism for our collection: <a href="https://ephemera.gallery">ephemera.gallery</a>.</p>

<p>We made an attribute generation algorithm that creates unique 3D assets rendered in the inscription using another inscribed JS library.  Ephemeris data from the JPL horizons api was pulled into each inscription and rendered on a funky and beautiful retro display. Users can bid on individual dates to inscribe on the kit.</p>

						<p> 
							<h5><strong> Asynchronous Event Infrastructure </strong> at Coinbase </h5>
							<p>When I joined Coinbase, there was no system for developers to emit events to downstream event-processing systems. This capability was essential for building next-generation real-time risk assessment and fraud prevention systems. We needed detailed event data from every step of the user flow for both training and evaluation.</p>

<p>I designed and implemented an asynchronous event pipeline using fluentD for the Coinbase monolith, enabling real-time data collection. The solution was lightweight and developer-friendly, significantly expanding our fraud detection capabilities during a period of rapid company growth.</p>
 
							<br>
						</p>
						
						

					
				
					

						<p> 
							<h5><strong> Risk Assessment Service </strong> at Postmates </h5>
							<p>Designed and built a real-time risk assessment service for Postmates. Using kinesis events, the service makes decisions for every single job on the platform as well as reconstructs customer and merchant data as a network graph.  The service increased the velocity and scope of anti-fraud measures available to the Risk team.</p>
 
							<br>
						</p>
						
						

					
				
					

						<p> 
							<h5><strong> PostGIS to Redshift ETL </strong> at Postmates </h5>
							<p>Postmates dealt with massive amounts of courier location data. I developed a feature for our core ETL pipeline that extracts geo-spatial data from a PostGIS format and stores it in AWS Redshift-compatible data types. This made vital geospatial data available to analysts for business intelligence.</p>
 
							<br>
						</p>
						
						

					
				
					

						<p> 
							<h5><strong> CNNs to Detect Trachoma </strong> at UCSF </h5>
							<p>At the UCSF Francis I. Proctor Foundation for Research in Ophthalmology, I designed and implemented an algorithm to classify field photographs of patients’ everted eyelids for trachoma infection. Using transfer learning from a large convolutional neural network, I extracted features to train a classifier that distinguishes between healthy eyelids and those showing follicles and inflammation.</p>

							<br>
						</p>
						
						

					
				
					

						<p> 
							<h5><strong> Counting bloom filter for spam detection </strong> at Argyle Data </h5>
							<p>I adapted and implemented the counting Bloom filter from the AT&amp;T research paper “Mitigating SMS Spam by Online Detection of Repetitive Near-Duplicate Messages”.  The filter produces  an on-line, probabilistic count of similar text messages in constant memory. Using this I was able to identify mass SMS campaigns and possible fraud in the client’s unlabeled database.</p>
 
							<br>
						</p>
						
						

					
				
					

						<p> 
							<h5><strong> Hidden Markov models for fraud </strong> at Argyle Data </h5>
							<p>Researched, adapted and implemented a hidden Markov model for fraud detection in a telecommunications data. We trained a one-class classifier for sequential data, which was used for anomaly detection, identifying previously unknown irregularities in customer behavior to the client.</p>

						<p>I provide consulting and independent contractor work in data engineering, infrastructure, analysis, machine learning systems design, and data strategy.</p>

<p>A well-designed data model and collection strategy is often the key determinant of a data project’s success. This means creating the right schema for your analytical needs while ensuring data warehouse immutability and job idempotency. Through my experience on data teams at high-growth startups, I’ve developed expertise in this detail-oriented work and built effective strategies to manage it. As a machine learning practitioner, I focus on building long-term capabilities to transform data into trained models and create valuable downstream data products.</p>

						<p>I have taught mathematics, statisitics, and computer science in both one on one and classroom settings.
I can aid with the following subjects:</p>

<ul>
<li>HS and lower division undergrad math (Algebra, Trig, Geometry, Calc, Stats etc.)</li>
<li>Linear Algebra</li>
<li>Probability and Statistics</li>
<li>Machine learning</li>
<li>Discrete Mathematics</li>
<li>Univariate and Multivariate Calculus</li>
<li>Algorithms</li>
<li>Software Engineering</li>
<li>Mock coding interviews</li>
</ul>

<p>Learning mathematics is hard.  But not any harder than learning music or a new physical 
skill.  Tutoring meetings should be expected to be high intensity training sessions
where we establish the framework for self study.  We set the correct expectations for the
domain of interest as well as workshop a disciplined and appropriately paced curriculum.</p>
