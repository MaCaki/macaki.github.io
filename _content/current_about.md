I do research in combinatorial optimization and machine learning.  My mathematical work deals with a class of polytopes related to classical finite reflection groups and submodular set functions. More broadly I am interested in algebraic combinatorics and discrete geometry.  I also build machine learning algorithms for medical applications.  Currently I am interested in transfer learning and convolutional neural networks to classifying eye diseases.
