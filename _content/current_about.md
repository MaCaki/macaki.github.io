I do research in combinatorial optimization and machine learning.  My mathematical work deals with a class of polytopes related to classical root systems and submodular set functions. More broadly I am interested in algebraic combinatorics and discrete geometry.  I also build machine learning algorithms for medical applications.  Currently I am interested applications of convolutional neural networks to eye diseases.
