company: "Argyle Data"
description: "I adapted and implemented a novel counting Bloom filter design from the AT&T research paper \"Mitigating SMS Spam by Online Detection of Repetitive Near-Duplicate Messages\".  The algorithm is an online method to stream and count similar text messages in fixed memory.  I was able to independently identify mass sms campaigns and possible fraud in the client's database."
