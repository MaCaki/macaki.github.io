description: "When I joined Coinbase, we had no way for developers to create and emit events for downstream event-processing systems. This would be crucial for developing the next generation of real-time ris assessment and fraud prevention systems.  We need granular event data produced at every point in the user flow for both training and evaluation. I designed and implemented an asynchronous event pipeline using fluentD for the Coinbase monolith, enabling real-time data collection. The solution was minimally intrusive and developer-friendly, significantly expanding our fraud detection capabilities during a period of rapid company growth."
