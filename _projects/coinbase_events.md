description: "When I joined Coinbase, there was no system for developers to emit events to downstream event-processing systems. This capability was essential for building next-generation real-time risk assessment and fraud prevention systems. We needed detailed event data from every step of the user flow for both training and evaluation. 

I designed and implemented an asynchronous event pipeline using fluentD for the Coinbase monolith, enabling real-time data collection. The solution was lightweight and developer-friendly, significantly expanding our fraud detection capabilities during a period of rapid company growth."
