description: "I worked with a digital artist and the lead developer of the ordinal protocol to create and launch a novel auction mechanism for our collection: [ephemera.gallery](https://ephemera.gallery). Using python and typescript, we made an attribute generation algorithm that would create unique 3D assets rendered in the inscription using another inscribed JS library.  Ephemeris data from the JPL horizons api was pulled into each inscription and rendered on a funky and beautiful retro display."
