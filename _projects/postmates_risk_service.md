description: "I designed and built the real time risk assessment service for Postmates. Using kinesis events, the service makes real time decisions for every single job on the platform as well as reconstructs customer and merchant data as a network graph.  The service increased the velocity and scope of anti-fraud measures available to the Risk team."
