description: "Square Bitcoin Conversions: Along with a designer, I brought a hack-week project from inception to GA over the course of 2022.  This project involved over seven different engineers over the course of about 4 quarters, starting with a HackWeek, going through a year long Alpha Release, and finally GAâ€™ing in April of 2024.  As the founding engineer, I acted as technical lead, project manager, and sometimes informal eng manager. 

I was embedded in both Square and CashApp engineering teams and worked closely with Square leadership to sell the vision and value of the feature, which included a presentation at the Block all company meeting alongside the Block Leadership.
