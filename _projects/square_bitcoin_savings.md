description: "I created the first integration of CashApp into Square seller accounts, enabling automated and instant transfer of card sale proceeds to CashApp for bitcoin conversion (effectively creating an SMB bitcoin treasury). After recruiting 5-7 engineers from across Block, I guided the project from hackweek through alpha release, culminating in general availability in April 2024. 


As the founding engineer, I served as technical lead, project manager, and occasional informal engineering manager. I collaborated closely with both Square and CashApp engineering teams while working with Square leadership to champion the feature's vision and value, including presenting alongside Block Leadership at the company-wide meeting.
