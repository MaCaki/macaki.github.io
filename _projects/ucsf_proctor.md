description: "At the UCSF Francis I. Proctor Foundation for Research in Ophthalmology, I designed and implemented an algorithm to classify field photographs of patients' everted eyelids for trachoma infection. Using transfer learning from a large convolutional neural network, I extracted features to train a classifier that distinguishes between healthy eyelids and those showing follicles and inflammation.
