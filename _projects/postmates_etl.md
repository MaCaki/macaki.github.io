company: "Postmates"
description: "Postmates dealt with massive amounts of courier location data. I developed a feature for our core ETL pipeline that extracts geo-spatial data from a PostGIS format and stores it in AWS Redshift-compatible data types. This made vital geospatial data available to analysts for business intelligence."
