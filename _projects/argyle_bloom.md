name: "Counting bloom filter for spam detection"
company: "Argyle Data"
description: "I adapted and implemented the counting Bloom filter from the AT&T research paper \"Mitigating SMS Spam by Online Detection of Repetitive Near-Duplicate Messages\".  The filter produces  an on-line, probabilistic count of similar text messages in constant memory. Using this I was able to identify mass SMS campaigns and possible fraud in the client's unlabeled database."
