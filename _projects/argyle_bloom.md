company: "Argyle Data"
description: "I adapted and implemented a novel counting Bloom filter design from the AT&T research paper \"Mitigating SMS Spam by Online Detection of Repetitive Near-Duplicate Messages\".  The filter produces  an online, probablisitic count of similar text messages in constant memory. Using this I was able to identify mass sms campaigns and possible fraud in the client's unlabeled database."
